RayTracer
=========

Around 2007 I attended a Computer Graphics cource at UCR (Universidad de Costa Rica). I've never had so much a fun in a course even though I was not on Master's program.

We develop multiple projects and this is one of them. We had to deliver a Ray Tracer in a few weeks. The first version was very basic, for the second one we added some interesting effects.

This is not product quality code at all, just a college project I found in my archive almost 6 year after I developed it.
